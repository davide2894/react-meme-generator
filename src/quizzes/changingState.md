1. You have 2 options for what you can pass in to a
   state setter function (e.g. `setCount`). What are they?

   1) you can pass the new value of state. For example: setCount(1);
   2) you can pass a callback function that returns the new value of state
   


2. When would you want to pass the first option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function? When you don't care what the previous value of state is, so that yuo only care what the new state value will be



3. When would you want to pass the second option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?

   I would pass the second options when I would want to modify the state value but I would need to know exactly what the previous state value is
